<p style="font-style:italic">For example, if you get <span style="font-style:normal">Impar e Par</span> where you could've gotten <span style="font-style:normal">Alvo Preciso</span>, you can only conclude <span style="font-style:normal">Alvo Preciso</span> isn't in the slots before <span style="font-style:normal">Impar e Par</span>. Click <span style="font-style:normal">Alvo Preciso</span> to make it TEAL, then click the slot containing <span style="font-style:normal">Impar e Par</span> to change <span style="font-style:normal">Alvo Preciso</span> to LIGHT TEAL.</p>
<p>RED means present. Click a slot to assign. Click the numeral to reassign.</p>
<p>BLUE means ruled out by exclusion and sequence rules. LIGHT BLUE means ruled out for at least half of the remaining slots OR diminished probability due to another instance of the effect on another wand.</p>
<p>PURPLE means forgotten. You can use it temporarily to visualize consequences. LIGHT PURPLE means ruled out for slots that have not been forgotten.</p>
